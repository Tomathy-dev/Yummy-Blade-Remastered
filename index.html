        <h3>To our League of Legends Guide</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to explain, very simply, the complexity of the game and how it's played, and we hope that our guide can help you grow into a competent and competitive player.</p>
        <p>Although our guide will be fairly big, you'll have to experience all the theory in-game, and the best way to do it is indubitably by playing.</p>

            <h1 class="h1">What's "League of Legends"?</h1>
            <p>League of Legends is a video game belonging to the MOBA genre, or <em>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</em>. It was created by Riot Games (or Rito, as players sometimes call it)in 2009, and has since become one of the most played online game of all time.</p>
            <p>Players are divided into 2 teams of 5, that fight to destroy the enemy's Nexus, an infrastructure located in the center of each team's base.</p>
            <p>At the beggining of each new match, players choose from 139 Champions (if owned) and costumize it with <a class="nav" target="_blank" href="runes.html">Runes</a>.</p>
            <p>If you want to sign up, you can visit <a target="_blank" id="lolsite" href="https://signup.euw.leagueoflegends.com/">the official League of Legends' website</a>.</p>

            <h1 class="h1">Accounts and Loot</h1>
            <p>At the beginning, every <u>Summoner</u> (Player) starts at level 1 and progresses indefinitely by playing the game. That is, at the end of every game, players receive a certain amount of <em>XP</em> (Experience Points), gaining levels which in turn gives other rewards (but we'll talk about them later on).</p>
            <p>There are three types of currency in League of Legends, such being <b>Blue Essence (BE)</b>, <b>Orange Essence(OE)</b> and <b>Riot Points(RP)</b>. <b>BE</b> is earned by disenchating Champion shards (earned after a level up or from a lootbox) and from completing the daily "Win of the Day" mission. It is used to upgrade Champion Shards (from level up lootboxes) and to buy various content in the shop, such as Champions. OE is used to upgrade Champion Skin Shards (earned from lootboxes) . <b>RP</b> is a currency purchased with real money and can be used to buy almost anything (even Champions), but it's mostly used to purchase cosmetic features (Champion Skins) that can only be bought with this currency.</p>
            <p>It is important to keep in mind that although Legue of Legends has microtransactions, the only thing that can be purchased with real money that actually affects the game are champions, but they can be bought easily with BE too. It should also be noted that lootboxes are fairly easy to obtain, so even players that do not put any money in the game can have Skins and other cosmetic features.</p>
