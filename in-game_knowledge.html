        <!-- TURRETS -->
        <h2>Turrets</h2>
        <p>These are statue-like towers that fire powerful <span class="lb">physical damage</span> attacks. They target the first <span class="lr">enemy</span> to step in range, but prioritize <span class="lb">minions</span> over <span class="lo">champions</span>. But if any <span class="lr">enemy</span> <span class="lo">Champion</span> <span class="lr">damages</span> an <span class="lgreen">ally</span>, that same <span class="lr">enemy</span> is immediatly focused by the <span class="lb">Turret</span>. <span class="lb">Turret</span>'s <span class="lr">damage</span> to a <span class="lo">champion</span> increases each subsequent attack. Their defenses increase when there is no <span class="lr">enemy</span> <span class="lb">minion</span> around them. Even more is that <span class="lb">Turrets</span> grant <span class="lp">true sight</span> in the area around them, which basically means anyone on the <span class="lr">enemy</span> team can be seen while near an <span class="lgreen">ally</span> <span class="lb">Turret</span>.</p><br>
        <p>Each team possesses 11 total <span class="lb">Turrets</span>, 3 guarding each <span class="lb">Lanes</span> and 2 protecting the <span class="lb">Nexus</span>. The farthest away a <span class="lb">Turret</span> is to the <span class="lgreen">allied</span> <span class="lb">base</span>, the lower its attack <span class="lr">damage</span>. <span class="lb">Turrets</span> do not regenerate <span class="lb">Health</span>, with the exception of the <span class="lb">Nexus Turrets</span>, the 2 <span class="lb">Turrets</span> who protect their <span class="lgreen">allied</span> <span class="lb">Nexus</span>.</p>
